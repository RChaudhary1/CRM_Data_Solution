# CRM_Data_Solution
## Problem
The marketing ops team sent over this spreadsheet containing four years of data from a CRM system. This data can be found here:

The team wants to find the month they're likely to contact the most clients, so they can schedule a product upgrade announcement. Which month does the team tend to contact the greatest percentage of its clients?

## What tools I used to solve the problem ?
I solved this problem by two methods:

1) MS Excel
2) Jupyter Notebook with Python 3. Also used data maipulation/visualization libraries like pandas and bokeh.

## Solution
Answer I got from both methods is the same: **October** is the month team tends to contact the greatest percentage of its clients. This observation can help the team to schedule a product upgrade announcement.

## Note:
There are comments in Jupyter notebook itself and excel. Also, there are README.md files to elaborate the process and observations.
