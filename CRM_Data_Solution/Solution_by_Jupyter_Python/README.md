# Jupyter Notebook Containing Solution

## I have used bokeh python library which uses JavaScript for visualization. Github is not able to render plots and is a known issue. To circumvent it there are following methods:
- Use nbviewer link to view notebook: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/RChaudhary1/CRM_Data_Solution/blob/master/CRM_Data_Solution/Solution_by_Jupyter_Python/solution_using_notebook.ipynb
- I have created and submitted a HTML file of the notebook and is in this directory of repo. Please download it and open in any browser which can use JavaScript.
- You can download the notebook itself i.e. .ipynb file and run it in your jupyter server after installing all dependencies.
